  about: |
    I am an experienced and passionate web developer. The past years I have been more active in the Browser but I do like getting my hands dirty on the other end of HTTP as well.

    I like mentoring people and help them grow. I had the wonderful opportunity to guide people into holding their first meetup or presentation. I also co-hosted some meetups together with friends just to get them started.
